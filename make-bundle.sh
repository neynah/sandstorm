See: http://sandstorm.io

This is a self-contained, batteries-included Sandstorm server. It should
work on any Linux kernel whose version is 3.13 or newer. The rest of your
filesystem is not touched and may as well be empty; everything will run in
a chroot.

This bundle is intended to be installed using the Sandstorm installer or
updater. To install Sandstorm, please run:

    curl https://install.sandstorm.io | bash

If you have already installed Sandstorm, you can update your installation to
this version by running:

    service sandstorm update <filename>.tar.xz
